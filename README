This script produces chart of nuclides in svg format from data
provided in xml document. The chart in svg format is especially suitable
for all kinds of presentations or posters since the SVG graphics is scalable
without loss of quality.

An example output is provided in example.svg file.

    usage: ChartDrawer.py [-h] [--names] [--halflives] [--magic] [--numbers]
                        [--z Z Z] [--n N N]
                        datafile outfile

    positional arguments:
    datafile     Input data base XML file (required)
    outfile      Output data SVG file (required)

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help   show this help message and exit
    --names      Show names
    --halflives  Show half-lives
    --magic      Show magic numbers
    --numbers    Show numbers along axis
    --z Z Z      Atomic number Z range (int), default: [0, 120]
    --n N N      Neutron number N range (int), default: [0, 180]

The Nubase2xml.py script will generate the input xml file from Nubase format

The NuBase ascii file can be downloaded from:
http://amdc.in2p3.fr/nubase/nubtab03.asc

Please note that the database is old (2003) so many values are outdated.
As soon as expected NuBase2013 is released the Nubase2xml script will 
be updated to parse new data format.

The generated chart of nuclides is following (but not precisely) the format
of Karlsruher Chart of Nuclides. The nuclides are coded with colors according to
primary decay mode:
Black - stable
Yellow - Alpha
Red - B+/EC
Blue - B-
Green - fission
Orange - proton / two-proton emission
Violet - cluster emission
Light blue - neutron / two-neutron emission

Secondary decay mode is indicated by triangle. A large triangle is used if
secondary decay mode branching is larger then 5%. Otherwise small triangle is
used (likewise for tertiary decay mode).

A Nuclide class provides parser to read data from NuBase ascii file or xml
document. Note that some informations are not being used on the chart 
(e.g. mass of nuclides, isomeric states), but are present in the data base.
The Nuclide class can easily used to write scripts using these informations 
as well.
